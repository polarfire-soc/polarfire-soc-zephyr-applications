        Clock source to be used by the PDM peripheral. The following options
        are available:
        - "PCLK32M": 32 MHz peripheral clock, synchronous to HFCLK
        - "PCLK32M_HFXO": PCLK32M running off the 32 MHz crystal oscillator
          (HFXO) for better clock accuracy and jitter performance
        - "ACLK": Audio PLL clock with configurable frequency (frequency for
          this clock must be set via the "hfclkaudio-frequency" property
          in the "nordic,nrf-clock" node); this clock source is only available
          in the nRF53 Series SoCs and it requires the use of HFXO
      enum:
        - "PCLK32M"
        - "PCLK32M_HFXO"
        - "ACLK"

        by the driver.
