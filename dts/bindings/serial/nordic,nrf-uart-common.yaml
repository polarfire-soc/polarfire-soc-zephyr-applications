        The TX pin to use.

        For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
        to use P0.16 for TX, set:

            tx-pin = <16>;

        For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
        example, to use P1.2 for TX, set:

            tx-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */

    rx-pin:

      description: |
        The RX pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same as the
        tx-pin property's.

      required: false
      description: |
        The RTS pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same as the
        tx-pin property's.

        The CTS pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same as the
        tx-pin property's.
